# Library Management System - Python
**Library Management System with GUI, made using Python (1st semester Hackathon Project)** made using python which uses funcnalities of python combined with .csv files to manage a library database by including new students and books into the database and issuing books to students and then even assigning penalty based on book return date.

**Implementation:** Copy the Library Management System - Python folder on your local system and make sure to include the .csv files in the same folder as the python file. Run the python file by clicking on it which upon successful execution will open a GUI interface where in you can input values accordingly and create/edit the database. New students and books can be added, books can be issued to students based on ID and/or name and penalty can be calculated.
